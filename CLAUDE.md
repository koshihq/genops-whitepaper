# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **GenOps Runtime Control Planes** whitepaper - a technical document focused on runtime governance and control planes for AI workloads. GenOps (Generative Operations) represents the operational framework for managing AI systems in production environments, with particular emphasis on observability, governance, and control through OpenTelemetry integration.

The whitepaper explores how to implement runtime control planes that provide real-time governance, monitoring, and management capabilities for AI workloads at scale.

## Whitepaper Details

- **Current Version**: v0.1 (initial release)
- **Focus**: Runtime control planes for AI workload governance
- **Key Technologies**: OpenTelemetry, observability frameworks, AI operations
- **Target Audience**: DevOps engineers, AI engineers, platform architects

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains:
- `README.md` - Brief project description
- `LICENSE` - Apache License 2.0
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance file
- `paper/` - Directory containing the whitepaper files
  - `GenOps_Runtime_Control_Planes_v0.1.pdf` - Current version of the whitepaper

Expected future structure:
- Whitepaper content (Markdown format extracted from PDF)
- Supporting diagrams and technical illustrations
- Reference implementations or code examples
- Documentation for GenOps patterns and practices

## Development Workflow

When working with this whitepaper project:

### Version Management
- Whitepaper follows semantic versioning (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
- Major versions indicate significant content restructuring
- Minor versions indicate content additions or substantial edits

### Content Development
- Primary content should be in Markdown for version control
- Include clear section headers and structured navigation
- Support diagrams with appropriate alt-text and descriptions
- Maintain consistency in technical terminology

### Technical Documentation Best Practices
- Use consistent formatting for code examples and technical concepts
- Include proper citations and references for external sources
- Maintain a glossary of GenOps-specific terminology
- Structure content for both linear reading and reference use

## Key Concepts

This whitepaper addresses:
- Runtime governance patterns for AI workloads
- Control plane architectures for AI systems
- OpenTelemetry integration for AI observability
- Operational frameworks for generative AI in production
- Scalability and reliability patterns for AI infrastructure
