This whitepaper provides the operational foundation outline for GenOps AI practices. 

For code implementation, see the GenOps OpenTelemetry Extension: **[GenOps Repository](https://github.com/koshihq/genops-spec)**



## Overview

**GenOps (Generative Operations)** represents a new operational paradigm for managing AI systems at scale. This whitepaper focuses specifically on runtime control planes that provide real-time governance, monitoring, and management capabilities for AI workloads, with deep integration into OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability.

As AI systems become increasingly critical to business operations, the need for robust operational frameworks becomes paramount. GenOps addresses the unique challenges of operating AI workloads, including model governance, performance monitoring, resource optimization, and compliance management.

## Related Implementation

The [GenOps](https://github.com/koshihq/genops-spec) extension implements the runtime control plane concepts described in this whitepaper as an OpenTelemetry extension, providing real-world tooling for AI workload governance and observability. While this whitepaper explores the architectural patterns and theoretical frameworks, the [GenOps](https://github.com/koshihq/genops-spec) extension offers the concrete implementation for immediate adoption in production environments.
